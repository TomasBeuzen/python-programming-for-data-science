    "In this lab, you'll complete various exercises related to Python functions, tests, classes, & imports. This lab will help you write better functions in Python, build classes and subclasses, and write tests. The assignment is based on the task of simulating stock prices over time. Note that there are 9 Exercises, but only 6 are required. Only some Exercises are provided with tests for you to test your solutions. The final question of this lab is tough but is good practice for using Python classes!"

    "We will simulate a stock's price fluctuation over time by assuming the stock price follows a [_geometric Brownian motion_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_Brownian_motion). In Lab 1 you simulated a random walk which is essentially Brownian motion: at each time step you add a small random amount to your current position. In geometric Brownian motion, at each time step you _multiply_ your current state by a (positive) random amount. Note that in regular Brownian motion the position can be both positive or negative, but in geometric Brownian motion the position is always positive; this is good because stock prices are never negative. An example is shown in the figure below:\n",

You can generate these random draws with `gauss(0, 1)` (which we imported from the `random` module at the start of the lab). Python comes with a built-in module called `math` (which we imported at the start of the lab with `import math`). `math` contains a variety of useful math operations such as `math.exp()`, `math.sqrt()`, `math.log()`, and `math.pow()`, which you may use throughout this lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "The parameter $\\sigma$ is the _volatility_ of the stock. The volatility is analogous to the step size in a random walk: a larger volatility means more movement in a given amount of time. (Note that if $\\sigma=0$ then the stock price never changes, whereas if $\\sigma$ is large the stock price can change wildly). The figure above  was generated using $S_0=10$, $\\sigma=0.01$, and $T=1000$."

    "A _stock option_ or [_call option_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_option) is a promise that you will be allowed (but not obligated) to buy a certain stock for a certain price at a certain time. For example, I might have a stock option for 1 Google share with a _strike price_ of $500 and an _expiration date_ of one year from now. This means that, if I want to, I have the option to buy 1 Google share for $500 in one year. \n",
    "\n",
    "So, under what circumstances would I want to do that? Well, if the Google stock price one year from now is $400, then I certainly would not want to exercise my option to pay $500 when I could be paying $400 for the same thing! Therefore, we say that the option turned out to be worthless if the share price is below the strike price at the expiration date of the option.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the Google share price turned out to be $600 one year from now, then I'm in luck: by exercising my option to buy a share for $500, and then immediately selling it at the market price of $600, I have made a profit of $100. A representation of what we just said in mathematical symbols is that, at the expiration time $T$, the option's profit $P_T$ is a function of the strike price $X$ (defined at time $T$) and **the stock price at the expiration date $S_T$** given by\n",

    "Ponder this for a moment and make sure you understand how the math corresponds with the explanation above (*note: we are using the word profit a bit loosely; in reality, you would need to pay for the option in the first place. In general, please forgive any financial misdemeanors here*)."

    "An important question that arises is, what is an option's fair value at the time it is issued ($t=0$), **before** we know what is going to happen to the stock price? To use our previous example, if Google shares currently trade at $500, how much would you pay for an option to buy it for $500 in one year? Or $600 in one year? Or $600 in two years? Indeed, the option value will depend on the strike price and the duration, among other things.\n",

    "Although the problem of valuing an option has been addressed theoretically (see Exercise 4), we will estimate it empirically by simulating the stock price with `simulate(S0, σ, T)`, and then computing the option profit $P_T$ with `option_profit(S, X)`. Sometimes the simulation will yield a worthless option (because the stock price is below the strike price), and other times it will be worth something (because the stock price is above the strike price). By repeating the simulation many times and taking the average, we can compute an \"expected\" or average value of the option, which we will take to be its fair value ($P_0$). This general approach of simulating a random process in order to understand its characteristics is called a [_Monte Carlo method_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method)."
